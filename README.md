# Hotel Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of hotel data, covering aspects such as data reading, cleaning, descriptive analysis, and spatial analysis. The goal is to derive insights into room types, pricing, and guest arrival patterns.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Reading**
   - Utilizes Python to read hotel data, extracting relevant information for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Involves cleaning the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.

3. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Performs exploratory data analysis to understand the basic statistics and characteristics of the dataset.

4. **Spatial Analysis**
   - Utilizes spatial analysis techniques to explore geographical patterns in the data.

5. **Room Types Comparison**
   - Investigates whether there is a difference between assigned and reserved room types.

6. **Avg. Price per Night (ADR) Analysis**
   - Analyzes the average price per night for various room types across different market segments.

7. **Total Guests Arrival per Day**
   - Calculates and visualizes the total number of guests arriving on each day.

8. **Guests Arrival Distribution Analysis**
   - Examines the distribution of guests' arrival to identify patterns or trends.
